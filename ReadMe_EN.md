# The GitHub Archive Program &amp; Arctic Code Vault

This repository is home to materials for the  [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

We previously opened the [Guide to the GitHub Code Vault](./GUIDE.md) to community input. This guide is included at the beginning of each of the 186 hardened film reels we used to archive every active public GitHub repository as of 2/2/2020. Please create a pull request for any specific proposed additions, deletions, or edits you may have for future iterations of the guide.

We are now also opening up [the initial compilation of Tech Tree resources](./TheTechTree.md) to community input. Inspired by the Long Now Foundation's [Manual for Civilization](https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/manual-for-civilization/home), the Tech Tree is a collection of technical works which document and explain the layers of technology on which today's open-source software relies, along with works included to provide additional cultural context for the Arctic Code Vault. We invite further suggestions and recommendations; please create a pull request for any specific proposed additions, deletions, or edits. You can also open an issue if you have a more general idea, although we particularly encourage specific and concrete suggestions in the form of pull requests.
